Description: multimedia player and streamer
 VLC is the VideoLAN project's media player. It plays MPEG, MPEG-2, MPEG-4,
 DivX, MOV, WMV, QuickTime, WebM, FLAC, MP3, Ogg/Vorbis files, DVDs, VCDs,
 podcasts, and multimedia streams from various network sources.

 reads and multicasts them through the network to other clients, or serves
 them through HTTP.
 .
 VLC has support for on-the-fly transcoding of audio and video formats, either
 for broadcasting purposes or for movie format transformations. Support for
 most output methods is provided by this package, but features can be added by
 installing additional plugins:
