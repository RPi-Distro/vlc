The Creative Commons Attribution 2.5 Scotland license:

 |  This Creative Commons Scotland public licence enables You to Use the
 |  Work worldwide provided that You keep to the terms of this Licence.
 |
 |  'The Licensor' (the Person offering the Work under the terms and
 |  conditions of this Licence)
 |
 |  and
 |
 |  'You' (the Person acquiring rights under this Licence)
 |
 |  agree as follows:
 |
 |  1. Definitions of Capitalised Words
 |    1. "Collective Work" means a work made up of the Work in its entirety
 |       in unmodified form, along with other work, assembled into a
 |       collective whole.
 |    2. "Derivative Work" means a work that Uses the Work (or any
 |       substantial part of the Work) in any material form whatsoever
 |       (such as a translation, dramatisation, or abridgment), other than
 |       (i) as a whole and in unmodified form or (ii) by modifying it as
 |       may be technically necessary to Use it in a different mode or
 |       format; but a Collective Work is not a Derivative Work for the
 |       purpose of this Licence.
 |    3. "Derogatory Treatment" means derogatory treatment as defined by
 |       section 80 of the Copyright Design and Patents Act 1988, except as
 |       allowed by that Act: and it has that meaning wherever that
 |       treatment may take place and whoever may carry it out.
 |    4. "Licence Elements" means the following licence attributes
 |       indicated in the title of this Licence: Attribution.
 |    5. "Original Author" means the Person who created the Work.
 |    6. "Person" means a natural person or a body of persons corporate or
 |       incorporate.
 |    7. "Use", as a verb, means doing any act which is restricted by
 |       copyright, whether in the original medium or any other; and
 |       includes modifying the Work as may be technically necessary to Use
 |       it in a different mode or format.
 |    8. "Work" means the work protected by copyright which is offered
 |       under the terms of this Licence, and includes the Work as
 |       incorporated in any Collective Work.
 |    9. Words in the singular include the plural and vice versa.
 |
 |  2. The Rights Granted
 |
 |  2.1 The Licensor grants to You a worldwide, royalty-free,
 |  non-exclusive, licence to Use the Work for the duration of its
 |  copyright.
 |
 |  So you may, for example:
 |    1. copy the Work, or create Derivative Works or incorporate it into a
 |       Collective Work;
 |    2. copy Derivative Works, or the Work as incorporated in any
 |       Collective Work; and
 |    3. publish, perform or communicate the Work and/or Derivative Works
 |       and/or the Work as incorporated in any Collective Work to anyone;
 |
 |  in any medium whether now known or created in the future.
 |
 |  2.2 However, this Licence does not allow you to:
 |    1. impose any terms or any technological measures on the Work, or a
 |       Derivative Work, that alter or restrict the terms of this Licence
 |       or any rights granted under it or have the effect or intent of
 |       restricting the ability of any person to exercise those rights;
 |    2. sublicense the Work; or
 |    3. subject the Work to Derogatory Treatment.
 |
 |  2.3 You must, if you publish or distribute the Work or any Derivative
 |  Work to anyone else in any way, give reasonable credit to the Original
 |  Author as follows:
 |    1. by giving the name of the Original Author if that has been
 |       supplied; or a pseudonym if that has been supplied instead; and/or
 |       the name of any other person if that has been supplied for
 |       attribution in place of the Original Author;
 |    2. by giving the title of the Work if that has been supplied;
 |    3. by giving the Uniform Resource Identifier of the Work if that has
 |       been supplied, but you need not do so if this does not refer to
 |       its copyright terms or to its licensing information;
 |    4. in the case of a Derivative Work, by identifying how the Work has
 |       been used (for example, "French translation of the Work by X", or
 |       "Screenplay based on original work by X"); and
 |    5. in the case of a Derivative Work or a Collective Work, placing
 |       that credit in the same place, and at least as prominently, as any
 |       comparable authorship credit.
 |
 |          But, if what you are publishing or distributing is a Derivative
 |          Work or a Collective Work, you must remove any of these credits
 |          if you are asked to do so by the Licensor and if it is
 |          practicable to do so.
 |
 |  These are important conditions of this licence and if you fail to do
 |  so you will be in material breach of its terms.
 |
 |  2.4 The Original Author asserts the right to be identified as the
 |  original author of the Work; but only as and when required by clause
 |  2.3 above.
 |
 |  2.5 You must also, if you publish or distribute the Work or any
 |  Derivative Work to anyone else in any way:
 |    1. include a copy of this Licence (or its Uniform Resource
 |       Identifier) with it; and
 |    2. keep intact any copyright notices for the Work and notices that
 |       refer to this Licence.
 |
 |  These are important conditions of this licence and if you fail to do
 |  so you will be in material breach of its terms.
 |
 |  2.6 Each time You publish the Work or any Derivative Work to anyone
 |  else in any way, the Licensor offers to the recipient a licence to the
 |  Work on the same terms and conditions as this Licence.
 |
 |  2.7 And:
 |    1. the right to release the Work under different terms, or to stop
 |       distributing the Work, is reserved; and
 |    2. all other rights not expressly granted by the Licensor are
 |       reserved.
 |
 |  2.8 This Licence does not affect any rights that You or anyone else
 |  may independently have under any applicable law (including fair
 |  dealing, fair use, or any other legally recognised limitation or
 |  exception to copyright infringement) to make any Use of this Work.
 |
 |  3. Warranties and Disclaimer
 |
 |  3.1 The Work is licensed by the Licensor "as is" and without any
 |  warranty of any kind, either express or implied, whether of title, of
 |  accuracy, of fitness for purpose, or otherwise.
 |
 |  4. Limit of Liability
 |
 |  4.1 Subject to any liability which may not be excluded or limited by
 |  law, the Licensor shall not be liable for, and expressly excludes, all
 |  liability for loss or damage however and whenever caused to anyone by
 |  any Use under this Licence, whether by You or by anyone else, and
 |  whether caused by any fault on the part of the Licensor or not. If
 |  liability may not be excluded by law, it is limited to actual and
 |  direct financial loss to the extent it is caused by proved negligence
 |  on the part of the Licensor.
 |
 |  5. Termination
 |
 |  5.1 Any breach by You of the terms of this licence (for example, by
 |  distributing the work licensed without attributing authorship as
 |  appropriate) entitles the Licensor to terminate this Licence with
 |  immediate effect and without notice to you. Persons who have received
 |  the Work, Derivative Works, or Collective Works from You under this
 |  Licence, however, will not have their licences terminated provided
 |  their use is in full compliance with this Licence or a licence granted
 |  under clause 2.6 of this Licence.
 |
 |  5.2 If You are not in breach of the terms of this licence, the
 |  Licensor may not terminate your rights under it.
 |
 |  5.3 Unless terminated under clause 5.1, this Licence is granted to you
 |  for the duration of copyright in the Work.
 |
 |  6. General
 |
 |  6.1 If any provision of this Licence is held to be invalid or
 |  unenforceable, that shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
 |  the remainder of the terms of this Licence.
 |
 |  6.2 This Licence is the entire agreement between the parties with
 |  respect to the Work licensed here. It replaces any earlier
 |  understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work
 |  not specified here.
 |
 |  6.3 If You are in breach of the terms of this Licence (for example, by
 |  distributing the work licensed without attributing authorship as
 |  appropriate) you will not be entitled to rely on the terms of this
 |  Licence or to complain of any breach by the Licensor.
 |
 |  6.4 Neither You, nor anyone else, may enforce any provision of this
 |  Licence by specific implement or interdict.
 |
 |  6.5 This Licence is governed by the law of Scotland and the parties
 |  accept the exclusive jurisdiction of the Courts of Scotland to decide
 |  any action or claim directed against the Licensor.
 |
 |  6.6 If there is any dispute as to the meaning or effect of any
 |  provision of this Licence, it must so far as possible be read and
 |  given effect in a way that is compatible with the provisions of the
 |  Creative Commons generic licence, version 2.5, which has the same
 |  Licence Elements.
