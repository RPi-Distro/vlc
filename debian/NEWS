vlc (1.1.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Teletext decoding is now done through zvbi. It requires installing an
  extra packages: vlc-plugin-zvbi.

  Some control interface are now implemented in lua. The C equivalents are
  still present.
    + HTTP: Default is still the C-implemented one. Use -I luahttp to
      test the lua one. Remember to edit /etc/vlc/lua/http/.hosts
    + RC: Default is the new lua-implemented one. Use -I oldrc to use the 
      C one.
    + Telnet: Default is the new lua-implemented one. Use -I oldtelnet to
      use the C one.

vlc (0.9.8a-2) unstable; urgency=low

  HTTP interface:

   The .hosts file used to control which remote hosts have access to the http
  interface has been moved to /etc/vlc/http/hosts and is now a conffile.
   If you do more change to the http interface, you need to do that out of
  /usr/share/vlc/http and use --http-src option of vlc. If you don't, your
  modifications will get lost at the next upgrade of vlc.

  Running VLC as root:

   Since 0.9.0, VLC can't be run as root. If you need realtime priority or if
  you need to have VLC listening on a privileged port (<1024), then you need to
  use vlc-wrapper.

vlc (0.9.2-1) experimental; urgency=low

  Important changes in this new upstream version:

  * The HTTP interface is now only available on the local machine by default.
    If you want to make it available from other machines, you will have to
    edit the ".hosts" in /usr/share/vlc/http/ . If you're using the old http 
    interface, it's located in /usr/share/vlc/http/old/.hosts
 
  * The marq, mosaic and logo commands in the rc interface changed. They
    now require a target name as their first argument. Example:
    vlc --sub-filter "marq@test{marquee=Hello}" -I rc <somevideo>
    You can then use commands like: @test marq-marquee Goodbye
    If you didn't name the object using @test, its name will default to the
    plugin name (hence 'marq') in this example.
    These new commands are also available in the telnet interface.
 
  * The "rtp" access output module has been removed.
    Please use the RTP stream output instead, e.g.:
      Old: '#std{access=rtp,mux=ts,dst=239.255.1.2:5004,sap}'
      New: '#rtp{mux=ts,dst=239.255.1.2,port=5004,sap}'
 
  * You now need to append --m3u-extvlcopt to your command line to enable
    EXTVLCOPT options parsing in m3u playlists. Note that only a limited set
    of options is available to m3u playlists (CVE-2007-6683).
 
  * The old access:url syntax is no longer supported to resolve ambiguities
    with some file names. Use access://url instead.
     E.g.:  vlc:quit -> vlc://quit ;
            udp:@239.255.12.12 -> udp://@239.255.12.12
 
  * Cropping and padding in transcode are now done using the croppadd video
    filter. For example:
    transcode{vcodec=mp2v,vfilter=croppadd{cropttop=20,cropbottom=30,paddleft=100+}}
 
  * Canvas setting in transcode is now done using the canvas video filter.
    For example:
    transcode{vcodec=mp2v,vfilter=canvas{width=640,height=480}}
