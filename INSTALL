INSTALL file for the VLC media player

More extensive information for *nix, Windows, Mac OS X and BeOS users can be
found here: http://developers.videolan.org/vlc/

Bootstrapping VLC
=================

If you retrieved VLC from the git server and do not have a "configure"
script, please refer to the HACKING file.

Configuring VLC
===============

A typical way to configure VLC is:

   ./configure --prefix=/usr

See `./configure --help' for more information.

If you intend to debug stuff, you may want to compile with debugging
symbols:

   make distclean ; ./configure --prefix=/usr --enable-debug

We recommend using GCC to build VLC, though some people reported success
with the Intel C compiler (version 8) as well. GCC version 3.3 or higher is
required. On older systems (e.g. FreeBSD 4.x, BeOS), please select a more
recent version manually by setting the CC and CXX environment variables
appropriately while running the ./configure shell script.


Building VLC
============

Once configured, run `make' to build VLC.


Installing and running VLC
==========================

You can install the VLC and its plugins by typing:

   make install

But you don't need to install it if you don't want to; VLC can be launched
from the current directory as well:

   ./vlc


Building packages
=================

To build a Debian package, you need to get the packaging info
   svn co svn://svn.debian.org/pkg-multimedia/videolan/vlc/debian debian 
and then
   dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -us -uc


To build RPM packages, copy a spec file from extra/package/rpm and:

   rpm -ba vlc.spec

To build an ipkg package (iPAQ familiar Linux), use:

   ipkg-buildpackage
