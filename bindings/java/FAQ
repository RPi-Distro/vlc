= Frequently Asked Questions =

== 1. Is it possible to use JVLC in a Java Applet? ==

Yes and No.
Yes because it's a Java program and even if it contains 
native code, it is still possible to deploy the applet (take a look at 
[http://www.raditha.com/java/jni/ this] article).
No because native code for the Windows and MacOS platforms still needs
to be written.

== 2. Is it possible to use JVLC in Windows (or MacOS)? ==

Yes, you can compile VideoLAN Java Bindings with --enable-java-bindings
in ./configure . It works for GNU/Linux and Win32, but it doesn't for MacOS.

== 3. What features of Videolan are available to JVLC? ==

JVLC contains all the features available in Videolan. In fact, JVLC uses
Videolan core as its core, so JVLC is capable of everything Videolan can
do.

== 4. Why shouldn't I use JMF (Java Media Framework) for multimedia
 applications? ==

Well, JVLC and Videolan are free (as in freedom) software, so you can extend
and adapt them to your needs, while JMF is free as in beer. Furthermore JVLC
is really straightforward and simple to use.

== 5. How can I help you with this application? ==

Try the software and report any errors or bugs you find to me. This application
needs porting to MS/Windows and MacOS, if you are able to implement the JNI for
these platforms you may contribute the code.

== 6. I have a compile error, what's the problem? ==

Did you set the JAVA_HOME environment variable? If not, do:

export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/jvm

For example I added to my .bashrc:

export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/j2sdk1.5-sun
